# CODSOFT-MACHINE LEARNING INTERNSHIP

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during my Machine Learning Internship at CODSOFT, which took place from **July 25, 2024, to August 25, 2024**. The internship involved completing various machine learning projects, each focusing on a specific problem domain. The tasks covered include:

1. **Movie Genre Classification**
2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
3. **Customer Churn Prediction**
4. **Spam SMS Detection**

Each project directory contains the code, datasets, and outputs related to the task, along with a detailed description of the approach and results.

## Projects

### 1. [Movie Genre Classification](Task_1_Movie_Genre_Classification/README.md)
   - Predicting movie genres based on plot summaries using text classification techniques.

### 2. [Credit Card Fraud Detection](Task_2_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection/README.md)
   - Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms.

### 3. [Customer Churn Prediction](Task_3_Customer_Churn_Prediction/README.md)
   - Predicting customer churn for subscription-based services using historical data.

### 4. [Spam SMS Detection](Task_4_Spam_SMS_Detection/README.md)
   - Classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate using natural language processing techniques.

Each project directory provides a deeper dive into the methodology, models used, and outcomes of the analysis.
